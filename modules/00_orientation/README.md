## 🗂 Activities

### 1. Course Tour

Read the [course README](../../README.md) and [COURSE.md](../../syllubus/COURSE.md) to get the big picture.

### 2. Personal Goals & Journal

Log your:

* Motivations
* Time commitment
* Current understanding of AI and Rust
* What success looks like for you

### 3. Team Onboarding (Optional)

If you’re learning with a team:

* Assign roles (e.g. repo owner, evaluator, infrastructure)
* Set up a shared chat (Slack, Discord, GitHub Issues)
* Align on the weekly schedule

### 4. Try ChatGPT as a Copilot

Use GPT-4 or ChatGPT-3.5 to:

* Ask questions about the syllabus
* Draft an initial milestone plan for Modules 0–3
* Summarize a concept like "What is a LoRA adapter?"

## 🧪 Lab: AI Self-Assessment

Use the following prompt in ChatGPT:

```markdown
I’m starting a hands-on course called “Train Your Dragon” to build my own low-hallucination coding LLM. Please interview me with 5 questions to:
- Assess my strengths in Python, Rust, or ML
- Discover my goals
- Recommend a weekly learning plan for Modules 0 to 3
```

Document the results in your learner journal.
