# üß∞ Module 16: Tool Use & Multi-Agent Systems

This module introduces the architecture, coordination, and reliability concerns of building LLM-powered tool users and multi-agent teams. You‚Äôll learn how to plan agent flows, call external tools, and reason about intermediate results.

---

## üéØ Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

* Build LLM agents that call tools via functions or APIs
* Understand the planner ‚Üí executor model
* Coordinate multi-agent workflows and turn-taking
* Add verification and fallback logic for robustness

---

## ‚úÖ Skills Gained

* Function-calling architecture design
* Intermediate state handling and response composition
* Planner-reasoner-executor modeling
* Tool + agent coordination patterns

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Activities

### 1. Architect an LLM + Tool Pipeline

* Input: User task (‚ÄúSummarize and email today‚Äôs server errors‚Äù)
* Tools:

  * `log_reader()`
  * `summarize()`
  * `send_email()`
* Output: Flowchart or pseudo-code with LLM-agent prompts per step

---

### 2. Implement Function Calling Wrapper

* Use OpenAI / HF Tools format:

  * Tool: `def weather(city) -> {temp, humidity}`
  * Prompt: ‚ÄúCall `weather(city=...)` then report outcome‚Äù
* Inject tool metadata into context and test calls

---

### 3. Design a Planner-Reasoner-Executor Agent

* Planner: splits goals
* Reasoner: verifies tool results
* Executor: executes and returns final output
* Structure as YAML or pseudo-Python

---

### 4. Build a Multi-Agent Dialogue

* Roles:

  * Planner
  * Researcher
  * Validator
  * Presenter
* Simulate turn-based logic using history + role prefixes
* Log actions and decisions

---

## üß™ Lab: Function Call & Replay

1. Define 3 dummy tools: search(), calc(), log()
2. Simulate an agent planner calling them with args
3. Log result, validation step, and final message
4. Bonus: Replay call chain on new task with shared cache
