# 🔥 Module 13: Adversarial Testing & Robustness

This module teaches how to pressure-test your model with edge cases, fuzzing, and adversarial prompts. You'll explore how to identify vulnerabilities, track failure types, and harden your model against unreliable or unsafe behavior.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

* Understand what makes an LLM vulnerable to hallucination, injection, or denial
* Design adversarial test prompts and mutation strategies
* Track failures and create coverage reports
* Simulate user attacks and test sandbox protections

---

## ✅ Skills Gained

* Red teaming and model fuzzing
* Prompt mutation and behavior probing
* Failure taxonomy logging
* Reproduction and prompt injection resilience

---

## 🗂️ Activities

### 1. Define Failure Classes

| Type          | Description                            |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Hallucination | Confident wrong answer                 |
| Refusal       | Unjustified “I cannot help”            |
| Injection     | Prompt hijack or role leak             |
| Looping       | Over-generation or non-stopping tokens |
| Unsafe        | Violent, illegal, toxic, NSFW output   |

---

### 2. Build a Red Team Prompt Set

* Create at least 5 examples of:

  * Hallucination bait
  * Injection probes (e.g. "Ignore previous...", "As an AI...")
  * Invalid or contradictory instructions

---

### 3. Run Prompt Mutation Fuzzing

* Use templates with slots:

  * "Summarize: {nonsense phrase}"
  * "What’s the capital of {non-country}?"
* Generate 50–100 test cases
* Run through model and classify responses

---

### 4. Log and Triage Failures

* Build a log format:

  * Prompt, output, label, severity, reproducible?
* Group:

  * Failure type
  * Model version
  * Fixes attempted

---

## 🧪 Lab: Fuzz and Flag

1. Write 10 templated prompt mutations
2. Run them through your model
3. Use simple regex or filters to flag odd results
4. Score risk level: Low / Medium / Critical

Bonus:

* Hook into hallucination eval
* Create a `redteam.jsonl` with source, intent, and result

## ✅ Completion Checklist

* [ ] I designed test prompts to expose weaknesses
* [ ] I tracked behavior patterns from risky inputs
* [ ] I recorded failure logs and outputs
* [ ] I categorized failure types by severity and model version
* [ ] I feel prepared to red team my own assistant or agent
