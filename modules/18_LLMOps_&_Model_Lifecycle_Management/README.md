# üîÅ Module 18: LLMOps & Model Lifecycle Management

This final module introduces practical workflows to manage the evolution of LLMs and their data: versioning, evaluation, promotion, auditing, rollback, and reproducibility.

---

## üéØ Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

* Apply software lifecycle principles to datasets, models, and prompts
* Track changes to checkpoints, outputs, and logs
* Automate audit trails and diffing for reproducibility
* Implement rollback and regression detection strategies

---

## ‚úÖ Skills Gained

* Model and dataset versioning
* Model registry and artifact tracking
* Change auditing and rollback planning
* GitOps-style promotion pipelines

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Activities

### 1. Create a Versioned Directory Layout

```text
models/
  model_v1.0/
    checkpoint.bin
    README.md
    eval.json
  model_v1.1/
    checkpoint.bin
    changelog.md
```

* Store:

  * Training command / seed
  * Metric diffs
  * Prompt/test set diffs

---

### 2. Set Up a Git-Backed Dataset + Prompt Registry

* Commit every new prompt/test with `author`, `reason`, `date`
* Review diffs during eval PRs
* Use tags or branches to snapshot major training sets

---

### 3. Log Model Metadata on Save

* Save:

  * Git commit SHA
  * Hardware + environment
  * Tokenizer version
  * Prompt schema used
* Store in `model.json` or model card

---

### 4. Add Regression + Promotion Checks

* Run:

  * `score.py` on test suite
  * `compare_metrics.py` vs previous checkpoint
* Approve promotion only if metrics are:

  * Better or same
  * Within confidence bounds

---

## üß™ Lab: Reproducibility Harness

1. Clone a `model_v1.0/` checkpoint
2. Restore same tokenizer, env, prompt set
3. Run identical eval and compare with prior `eval.json`
4. Confirm exact match or document variance

Bonus:

* Add `eval_diff.py` script to print deltas

---

* [Module 15: Evaluation Benchmarks](../15_Evaluation_Benchmarks_&_Leaderboards/README.md)

## ‚úÖ Completion Checklist

* [ ] I versioned a model with metadata and changelogs
* [ ] I tracked prompt/data diffs with Git or hash logs
* [ ] I ran regression tests and compared score deltas
* [ ] I validated reproducibility of a full checkpoint
* [ ] I feel confident deploying a model with rollback support
