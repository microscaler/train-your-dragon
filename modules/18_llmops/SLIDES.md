# ðŸŽ“ Slide Deck: Module 16 â€“ LLMOps & Model Lifecycle Management

---

## Slide 1: Welcome to Module 16

**Title:** Version, Audit, Promote, Rollback

> Note: Youâ€™ve built great models â€” now make them trustworthy.

---

## Slide 2: What Is LLMOps?

* Applying MLOps principles to LLMs:

  * Model versioning
  * Prompt/test tracking
  * Audit trails
  * Deployment safety

---

## Slide 3: Why Lifecycle Management Matters

* Avoid regressions
* Enable rollbacks
* Support compliance
* Reproducible science, not luck

---

## Slide 4: Model Version Directory Structure

```txt
models/
  model_v1.0/
    checkpoint.bin
    eval.json
    README.md
  model_v1.1/
    checkpoint.bin
    changelog.md
```

---

## Slide 5: Dataset & Prompt Registry

* Track:

  * Source
  * Author
  * Reason for inclusion
* Use Git diffs or structured JSONL
* Snapshot dataset states with tags

---

## Slide 6: Save Full Model Metadata

Include:

* Training config
* Tokenizer used
* Eval results
* Git SHA
* Hardware/accelerator

Format: `model_card.json` or HF model card

---

## Slide 7: Run Regression & Diff Checks

* Evaluate new model â†’ `metrics.json`
* Compare against prior â†’ `compare_metrics.py`
* Accept only if:

  * All required tests pass
  * Metrics within tolerance

---

## Slide 8: Promotion Process (GitOps style)

* PR includes:

  * New checkpoint
  * Updated leaderboard
  * `eval.json`
* Review:

  * Score change
  * Code + prompt diffs
* Merge = promotion

---

## Slide 9: Reproducibility Audit Harness

* Reload `model_vX`
* Re-run eval set with same seed/tokenizer
* Output new `eval.json`
* Confirm diff is zero or explainable

---

## Slide 10: Summary â€“ LLMOps Best Practices

* Every model = traceable artifact
* Every prompt = audit line
* Every promotion = reproducible decision
* This is how LLMs earn trust

---

## Slide 11: Final Project Aheadâ€¦

**Capstone Prep**

* Time to bring it all together
* Pick your domain: coding agent, red team tool, RAG service, etc
