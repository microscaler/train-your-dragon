# 👥 Module 09: Teaching & Scaling LLM Development in Your Org

This module shows how to introduce LLM development practices to your team, train others to contribute, and scale internal usage.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

* Design an internal onboarding path for AI engineering
* Train developers and researchers to use, fine-tune, and evaluate LLMs
* Set up roles, workflows, and docs for multi-team collaboration
* Build trust, reproducibility, and contribution culture around your model stack

---

## ✅ Skills Gained

* Teaching foundational concepts to others
* Organizing shared tooling (repos, datasets, logs)
* Managing contributions to models and training data
* Running internal workshops or AI design reviews

---

## 🗂️ Activities

### 1. Identify Roles in Your Team

* AI Product Owner
* Prompt & Evaluation Engineers
* Data Curators
* Training & Finetuning Engineers

> Goal: make LLM usage an accountable process, not a hobby project

### 2. Create an Internal Contribution Guide

* Where to store:

  * Datasets (`data/internal_curated/`)
  * Prompts (`prompts/`)
  * Eval logs (`logs/`)
* Define:

  * How to submit prompt fixes
  * How to document and validate hallucinations
  * How to test model deltas

### 3. Run a Team Prompt Jam

* Schedule a 60-minute session
* Ask everyone to:

  * Propose 3–5 prompts your assistant should answer
  * Label quality of base vs fine-tuned model outputs

> Encourage real use cases from support, onboarding, integration

### 4. Review Eval & Prompt Feedback as a Team

* Pull logs from `hallucination_eval.ipynb` or `checkpoint_comparator.ipynb`
* Discuss accuracy issues, hallucination hot spots
* Add 5–10 improvement prompts to dataset

---

## 🧪 Lab: Publish Your First Team Model

1. Set up a shared folder `models/team_checkpoints/`
2. Add README per model: date, trainer, goal, metrics
3. Document any known gaps or risks
4. Share link with a teammate and ask them to test with 3 prompts

Bonus:

* Use GitHub Issues to track model changes
* Include model changelog in `/models/model_v1.0/CHANGELOG.md`

## ✅ Completion Checklist

* [ ] I defined roles for team-based LLM work
* [ ] I created an internal prompt/data contribution guide
* [ ] I helped run or participate in a team prompt jam
* [ ] I shared a fine-tuned model with a peer for testing
* [ ] I feel confident scaling this to a team of 3–12 developers
