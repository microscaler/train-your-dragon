Great question. To make each training module robust, portable, and instructor-friendly, hereâ€™s a recommended standard layout:

---

## âœ… Module Structure Template

Each module folder (e.g. `modules/02_LLM_Architecture_&_Training_Foundations/`) should include the following:

### 1. `README.md` (Learner-Facing)

* What the module covers
* Learning objectives
* Skills gained
* Key activities
* Labs and checklists
* Linked modules or next steps

---

### 2. `SLIDES.md` (Instructor Slide Deck)

* Markdown-formatted lesson slides for presentation use
* Split into:

  * Slide titles (`##`)
  * Slide content (bullets/code/diagrams)
  * **Speaker notes** (in `> Note:` or `<!-- Instructor notes -->`)

ðŸ“˜ Tip: Can later be exported to PowerPoint or Reveal.js slides.

---

### 3. `labs/` (Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts)

* Hands-on, progressively scaffolded
* Educational commentary embedded
* Matching lab tasks from the `README.md`

---

### 4. `data/` (Reference content)

* JSONL examples, tokens, architecture diagrams, or tokenizer configs
* Used for training, testing, or visualization

---

### 5. (Optional) `slides.pdf`

* Exported `SLIDES.md` deck for offline use

---

### Optional Extras per Module

| File            | Purpose                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `quiz.md`       | Short quiz to recap theory             |
| `glossary.md`   | Definitions of new terms introduced    |
| `discussion.md` | Space for group debates or reflections |

---

Would you like me to scaffold this structure and apply it to Module 02 now â€” including a new `SLIDES.md` and `README.md`?
