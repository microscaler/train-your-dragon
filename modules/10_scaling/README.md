# 🛡️ Module 10: Data Governance, Licensing & Ethical AI Use

This module covers best practices for using, curating, and training on datasets responsibly. You’ll learn how to evaluate risks, apply safe data handling, and align your LLM pipeline with ethical and legal guidelines.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

* Understand the licensing implications of datasets and generated content
* Apply filtering and documentation to reduce legal or safety risks
* Redact or avoid PII and private company data in training corpora
* Incorporate ethical review practices into dataset curation

---

## ✅ Skills Gained

* Dataset license classification
* PII and risk filtering pipelines
* Dataset lineage tracking and audit logging
* Drafting dataset documentation and terms of use

---

## 🗂️ Activities

### 1. Understand Dataset Licenses

* MIT, Apache-2.0, GPL, CC-BY, Share-Alike, Proprietary
* Classify each license for commercial risk level
* Tools: `licensecheck`, GitHub metadata, SPDX

### 2. Create a Dataset Intake Policy

* Define:

  * What data is allowed (e.g. public domain, MIT)
  * What’s explicitly excluded (e.g. user chats, internal APIs)
  * Redaction policy for PII or secrets
* Store in `data/DATA_POLICY.md`

### 3. Redact or Filter Risky Samples

* Regex filter for emails, passwords, keys, phone numbers
* Ban lists (e.g. domain names, known auth tokens)
* Optional: use open-source tools like Presidio or Cleanlab

### 4. Document Dataset Origins

* For each dataset added:

  * Source URL or repo
  * Author/license
  * Preprocessing applied
* Store metadata in `data/registry.jsonl`

---

## 🧪 Lab: Build a Dataset Validator

1. Write a script to scan `.jsonl` or `.md` files
2. Detect and log PII or license-mismatch content
3. Output a filtered `clean.jsonl` and a `violations.csv`
4. Bonus: Store SHA-256 hashes of each file in `registry.jsonl`
