# Capstone Project 2: LLM-Powered Codebase Search

## 🧠 Goal
Use RAG to turn an LLM into a context-aware search assistant for a full codebase (Rust, Python, or monorepo).

## 📦 Dataset
- Your own repo or OSS repo
- Chunked + embedded for semantic search

## 🛠 Tasks
- Ingest source code and docs
- Enable queries like: “How is auth handled?” or “Where is S3 used?”
- Return relevant snippets with explanations

## ✅ Evaluation Criteria
- Relevant retrieval
- Grounded, non-hallucinated answers
