### 🧠 Phase 2: Team Training

Once you’ve done the first 5–6 modules:

* Clone the syllabus into a shared Google Doc or Notion workspace
* Use the same labs with your team
* Track who completes what (e.g. GitHub issues or Notion kanban)
* Use ChatGPT with your team in “Mentor Mode” (e.g. one model per team room)

---

### 📊 Phase 3: Model Building & Eval Loop

As soon as your team finishes:

* You all contribute to a real dataset
* You evaluate hallucinations as a team
* You host weekly model improvement checkpoints

Capstone: your team ships a small “company LLM” that plugs into IDEs, terminals, or your own web UI.

## 📌 How to Start Right Now

If you’re ready, we can begin immediately with:

### 👉 MODULE 0.5: Environment Setup & Tooling

* I’ll walk you through:

  * Option A: Local install (Mac, Linux, or Windows WSL2)
  * Option B: Cloud GPU (Colab, RunPod, Modal, etc.)
* Then we test a small `Unsloth` model
* You’ll verify the tokenizer and inference pipeline work

Just confirm:

> ✅ Would you like to begin with local setup or cloud GPU?
> 💻 What OS/hardware are you running?

Then we’ll launch 🚀
